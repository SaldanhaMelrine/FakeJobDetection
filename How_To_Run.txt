The code is not unified. So the code must be run in accordance to the following sequence:
extract_company
dataset_integration 
company_cred
extract_salary
gdp_expected_salary_augment
preprocessing

Modeling:
feature_set_a_modeling feature_set_ab_modeling feature_set_ab_tfidf_modeling

The necessary dataset files to run the codes are available in the dataset/

The Final_Job_Postings is the preprocessed training file that is used by modeling files feature_set_a_modeling, feature_set_ab_modeling, feature_set_ab_tfidf_modeling. These modeling files produce the final classification results. 

The intermediate results (files) are also available. 
Merged_Dataset: The result from running extract_company, dataset_integration,Â company_cred.
